# Skeleton Dark Mode

Skeleton Dark Mode is an extension to the [Skeleton CSS boilerplate project](http://getskeleton.com) to include dark mode and make minor updates. 

Check out <https://paultreanor.github.io/Skeleton-dark-mode/> for documentation and an active demo.

#### Change log 
- CSS seperated into main and themes (skeleton-light/skeleton-dark)
- Links are now only underlined when hovered over or active 
- Buttons give better feedback on hover and active 

## License

Skeleton Dark Mode follows the [open-source MIT license](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/blob/master/LICENSE.md) as Skeleton does.

## Acknowledgement

The origional fantastic Skeleton boilerplate was created by [Dave Gamache](https://twitter.com/dhg) for a better web.

## Contributing 

Always open to pull requests, but bigger extensions (ie. Adding cards or other non native HTML elements) might be better as a seperate fork to keep skeleton...skeletony.
