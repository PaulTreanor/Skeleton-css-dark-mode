Skeleton Dark Mode follows the [open-source MIT license](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/blob/master/LICENSE.md) as Skelton does.

## Acknowledgement

The origional fantastic Skeleton boilerplate was created by [Dave Gamache](https://twitter.com/dhg) for a better web.

## Contributing 

Always open to pull requests, but bigger extensions (ie. Adding cards or other non native HTML elements) might be better as a seperate fork to keep skeleton...skeletony.
